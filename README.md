# CrYnTr
Team We3DeGames presents you the best On-Boarding Application for the Crypto-Ecosystem: CrYnTr (Crypto-Enter)

# Problem Statement & Proposed Solution:
There are always people waiting to understand the concepts and the world of Crypto Markets. The wait time, or the LEARN TIME, for these guys is always very high or usually left away due to lack of interest or "time". 

There are multiple Metaverse with focus on Blockchain, NFT's and Games; but imagine a Metaverse with the ability to visualize your portfolio! A metaverse that can provide Risk Analysis, A metaverse that can provide Mirror investing, A metaverse that can provide you a community of Crypto-junkies to collaborate and interact.                                                           (Detailed explanaiton in the bottom of the page)

We are building a novel Web-based application where users, usually **newbies**, show interest to join the crypto-ecosystem in **Metaverse** to learn, earn, and interact while playing. CrYnTr (Crypto-Enter) is a web-application based Metaverse with the main intention to on-board as many as newbies to the world of crypto in the best immersieve and interactive way as possible. We built our application with the intention to keep every user stuck to our application; newbie, intermediate, and investors etc. Our users, upon entering the application would be able to see a few options to see their portfolio, know their attention tokens, called ATOMS (in-application coins). 

We have multiple features to keep the users intact with the application:

1. Community Support: A community support is definetely needed for "newbies" to make them feel at home. They need an application, more like a place to get their information properly understood and learnt the right way.

2. Easy On-boarding: Just a two-step process to enter the world of Cryptoverse! Cryptoworld is all about Privacy and Anonmity. 

3. Risk Managment:  

4. Mirror Investing

5. Dashboard Analytics: 

# TL;DR: 
Metaverse + Islands and characters to simulate your crypto portfolio + Immersive Experience via interacting with your investments while trading and holding your "assets".
