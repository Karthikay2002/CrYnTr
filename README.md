# CrYnTr
Team We3DeGames presents you the best On-Boarding Application for the Crypto-Ecosystem: CrYnTr (Crypto-Enter)

# Problem Statement & Proposed Solution:
There are always people waiting to understand the concepts and the world of Crypto Markets. The wait time, or LEARN TIME, for these guys is always very high or usually left away due to lack of interest and "time". 

We are building a Web-based application where users, usually newbies, show interest to join the crypto-ecosystem to learn, earn, and interact while playing. CrYnTr (Crypto-Enter) is a Metaverse based web-application with the main intention to on-board as many as newbies to the world of crypto in the best immersieve and interactive way as possible. We built our application with the intention to keep every user stuck to our application; newbie, intermediate, and investors etc. Our users, upon entering the application would be able to see a few options to see their portfolio, know their attention tokens, called ATOMS (in-app coins). 

Ever imagined, a place in METAVERSE where you could live, experience virtually, and look at your Crypto Portfolio? Welcome to We3DeGames, where we get all your crypto ecosystem's protfolio right into an immersive expereince in the world of Metaverse. We are building a part of Metaverse where we, as a player get access to look and care our farms as in terms of our portfolios of cryptocurrencies. The more larger your portfolio is, the more levels and higer status you gain in your world, at Metaverse.

TL;DR: Metaverse + Farms to simulate your crypto portfolio + Immersive Experience via interacting with your investments while trading and holding your "assets".
